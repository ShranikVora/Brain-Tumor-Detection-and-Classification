# Brain-Tumor-Detection-and-Classification
Brain Tumor Detection and Classification is an application build to classify an MRI scan of the brain into malignant types of Glioblastoma Multiforma and High-Grade Glioma and benign types of Meningioma and Pituitary Adenoma.

In todayâ€™s world, the brain tumor is a very rare but a deadly disease which you would
not wish on anyone. It is caused by abnormal growth of cells in the brain. The norm
right now for tumor classification is manually inspecting the magnetic resonance images
which is an invasive method. Once the MR images are inspected, a biopsy is performed
by the surgeon. The biopsy is performed to remove small piece of brain tissue which
is tested for abnormalities. MRI scans play an integral role in the diagnosis procedure.
Human inspection may lead to errors which may be deadly in cases of dealing with the
brain tumor. It is tedious as well because a tumor is of many kinds and the treatment
may differ based on the kind. The objective of the project is to provide a non-invasive
method to segment and classify the tumor into benign or malignant category. The MRI
scans of the brain will be segmented and the tumor part will be separated for further
analysis. After removing noise and segmentation, the segmented image will be sent
for feature extraction which will then classify the brain tumor to benign or malignant.
Further sub-classification will take place such as Glioblastoma Multiforme(GBM) or
glioma under malignant type and meningioma or pituitary adenoma under benign type
tumor.
